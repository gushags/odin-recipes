    <ul>
      <li>4 large croissants, halved horizontally, left out overnight</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, half-and-half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg
        together in a shallow bowl. Dip each croissant half into egg mixture,
        one at a time, flipping it and lightly pressing down, until well coated.

        Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add four croissant
        halves, cut-side down. Fry until browned on both sides, turning once, 2

        the remaining croissants.
